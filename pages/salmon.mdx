# Wallet Setup for Eclipse Devnet

You will need a wallet that is compatible with Eclipse. There are two options:

1. MetaMask Snaps
2. Salmon Wallet

## MetaMask Snaps Installation

If you already have MetaMask installed, installing the MetaMask Snap via a dApp that supports the Snap is straightforward. The UI for the wallet adapter will guide you.

## Salmon Wallet Installation

In this walkthrough, we'll download Eclipse's fork of the Salmon wallet. This wallet is only to be used for devnet purposes until it is fully audited. These instructions work on Chrome or any Chromium-based browser like Brave or Opera.

### Steps to Install Salmon Wallet

1. **Download the Zip File**
   - Download `build-extension_v0.4.2-alpha.zip` from the [GitHub repo](#).
   - Unzip the file.

2. **Enable Developer Mode**
   - Type `chrome://extensions` in your browser search bar.
   - Toggle on Developer mode in the top right corner of your browser.

3. **Install the Extension**
   - Drag and drop the unzipped/extracted folder (`build-extension_v0.4.2`) to your browser.
   - Pin the extension for easy access.

4. **Configure the Wallet**
   - Select Eclipse Devnet from the dropdown within Salmon Wallet.

### Detailed Installation Instructions

1. **Download the Zip File**
   - The first step is to download the zip file which contains the Chrome extension for the wallet and unzip it. We have uploaded the zip file (`build-extension_v0.4.2.zip`) to this [GitHub repo](#).

2. **Enable Developer Mode**
   - Type `chrome://extensions` into the address bar.
   - Enable Developer Mode in the top right corner.

3. **Install the Extension**

   - Drag the unzipped folder onto the `chrome://extensions` page.

4. **Pin the Wallet**
   - Click the Extensions icon to open your list of extensions, then click the pin button next to Salmon Wallet.
