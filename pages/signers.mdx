# Signers and Non-Signers

In Solana transactions, signers and non-signers play distinct roles in the authorization process.

## Signers

- **Authorization**: Signers are accounts that provide cryptographic signatures to authorize transactions.
- **Private Keys**: Signers possess the private keys corresponding to their associated public keys.
- **Authorization Instruction**: Signers explicitly approve transactions by signing them, thereby proving ownership and granting permission for the specified actions.

## Non-Signers

- **Involvement in Transactions**: Non-signers are accounts referenced in transactions but do not provide signatures.
- **Read-Only Access**: Non-signers are typically involved in read-only operations or do not require authorization for the transaction's execution.
- **Data Retrieval**: Transactions may reference non-signer accounts to retrieve data or perform computations without modifying their state.

## Transaction Authorization

- **Authorization Logic**: Transaction authorization logic determines which accounts must provide signatures and which can be referenced as non-signers.
- **Complex Transactions**: Some transactions may involve multiple signers and non-signers, each with specific roles and permissions.
- **Atomicity**: All instructions within a transaction must be authorized by their respective signers for the transaction to be executed atomically.

## Use Cases

### Signer Use Cases

- **Token Transfers**: Signers authorize token transfers by providing signatures for the sender's account.
- **State Changes**: Signers authorize state changes, such as updating balances or modifying program state.

### Non-Signer Use Cases

- **Token Balance Checks**: Non-signers may be referenced to check token balances without requiring authorization.
- **Data Retrieval**: Non-signers may be involved in data retrieval operations, such as fetching account state or performing computations based on existing data.

## Security Considerations

- **Private Key Protection**: Signers' private keys must be securely managed to prevent unauthorized access and potential misuse.
- **Authorization Logic**: Ensure that transaction authorization logic accurately reflects the intended permissions and security requirements of the application.

## Conclusion

Signers and non-signers are essential concepts in Solana transactions, providing a mechanism for controlling access to accounts and authorizing actions on the blockchain. Understanding the roles and responsibilities of signers and non-signers is crucial for designing secure and efficient decentralized applications.
