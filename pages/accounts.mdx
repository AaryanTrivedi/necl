# Accounts and Wallets

In Solana, accounts and wallets are fundamental components for managing data, identities, and transactions on the blockchain.

## Accounts

### Overview

- **Data Storage**: Accounts are used to store data persistently on the blockchain.
- **Types**: There are several types of accounts, including user accounts, program accounts, and data accounts.

### Key Properties

- **Public Key**: Each account is identified by a unique public key.
- **Owner Program**: The program that has control over the account and can modify its data.
- **Lamports**: The smallest unit of SOL (Solana’s native currency) stored in an account to pay for rent.

### Types of Accounts

- **User Accounts**: Hold SOL and other tokens, and are controlled by private keys.
- **Program Accounts**: Store executable code for smart contracts.
- **Data Accounts**: Store data that programs operate on, such as token balances or user information.

### Rent and Balance

- **Rent**: Accounts must maintain a minimum balance to remain active. This balance is used to cover the cost of storing data on the blockchain.
- **Rent Exemption**: If an account’s balance is above a certain threshold, it is considered rent-exempt and will not be purged from the blockchain.

## Wallets

### Overview

- **Purpose**: Wallets are tools for managing accounts and signing transactions.
- **Types**: Wallets can be software-based (web, mobile, desktop) or hardware-based.

### Key Functions

- **Account Management**: Wallets allow users to create, import, and manage multiple accounts.
- **Transaction Signing**: Wallets use private keys to sign transactions, authorizing actions on the blockchain.

### Types of Wallets

- **Software Wallets**: Applications that store private keys on devices like computers or smartphones. Examples include Phantom, Sollet, and Solflare.
- **Hardware Wallets**: Physical devices that securely store private keys offline. Examples include Ledger and Trezor.

### Security Considerations

- **Private Key Management**: The security of a wallet largely depends on how well private keys are protected.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Users should securely back up their wallet seed phrases to recover accounts in case of device loss or failure.

## Interactions

- **Connecting Wallets**: Wallets can connect to decentralized applications (DApps) to interact with smart contracts.
- **Transaction Fees**: Wallets must manage SOL balances to pay for transaction fees.

Accounts and wallets form the basis of identity, data storage, and transaction authorization.
